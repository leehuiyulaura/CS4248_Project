 if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.\n","Row:  139\n","Translating  And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.\n","Row:  140\n","Translating  So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.\n","Row:  141\n","Translating  If they get surrounded, they notice that too,  they might get a little flustered.\n","Row:  142\n","Translating  And they can also sense their motion and tilt.\n","Row:  143\n","Translating  One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,  was that we could use everyday gestures on data,  like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.\n","Row:  144\n","Translating  So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets  and I can use them to pour color into that central one,  where they get mixed.\n","Row:  145\n","Translating  If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.\n","Row:  146\n","Translating  There are also some neat possibilities for education,  like language, math and logic games  where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,  and view the results immediately.\n","Row:  147\n","Translating  So here I'm --    This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.\n","Row:  148\n","Translating  Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.\n","Row:  149\n","Translating  Basically, in every round  you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,  and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.\n","Row:  150\n","Translating  Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,  and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.\n","Row:  151\n","Translating  Thank you.\n","Row:  152\n","Translating  So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,  and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.\n","Row:  153\n","Translating  They really loved it.\n","Row:  154\n","Translating  And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application  is that you don't have to give people many instructions.\n","Row:  155\n","Translating  All you have to say is, \"Make words,\"  and they know exactly what to do.\n","Row:  156\n","Translating  So here's another few people trying it out.\n","Row:  157\n","Translating  That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.\n","Row:  158\n","Translating  Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.\n","Row:  159\n","Translating  So to him, they were just blocks.\n","Row:  160\n","Translating  Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.\n","Row:  161\n","Translating  And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.\n","Row:  162\n","Translating  And this is Felix, actually.\n","Row:  163\n","Translating  And he can bring new characters into the scene,  just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.\n","Row:  164\n","Translating  Here, he's bringing the sun out.\n","Row:  165\n","Translating  Video: The sun is rising.\n","Row:  166\n","Translating  David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.\n","Row:  167\n","Translating  Video: The orange tractor.\n","Row:  168\n","Translating  Good job!

use.\n","Row:  176\n","Translating  And you can inject these sounds into a sequence  that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.\n","Row:  177\n","Translating  And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.\n","Row:  178\n","Translating  There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.\n","Row:  179\n","Translating  You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.\n","Row:  180\n","Translating  And then, overall effects like tempo and volume  So let's have a look.\n","Row:  181\n","Translating  Video:   DM:

It's called the ATLAS detector --  44 meters wide, 22 meters in diameter.\n","Row:  99\n","Translating  Spectacular picture here of ATLAS under construction  so you can see the scale.\n","Row:  100\n","Translating  On the 10th of September last year we turned the machine on for the first time.\n","Row:  101\n","Translating  And this picture was taken by ATLAS.\n","Row:  102\n","Translating  It caused immense celebration in the control room.\n","Row:  103\n","Translating  It's a picture of the first beam particle  going all the way around the LHC,  colliding with a piece of the LHC deliberately,  and showering particles into the detector.\n","Row:  104\n","Translating  In other words, when we saw that picture on September 10th  we knew the machine worked,  which is a great triumph.\n","Row:  105\n","Translating  I don't know whether this got the biggest cheer,  or this, when someone went onto Google  and saw the front page was like that.\n","Row:  106\n","Translating  It means we made cultural impact  as well as scientific impact.\n","Row:  107\n","Translating  About a week later we had a problem with the machine,  related actually to these bits of wire here -- these gold wires.\n","Row:  108\n","Translating  Those wires carry 13 thousand amps  when the machine is working in full power.\n","Row:  109\n","Translating  Now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say,  \"No they don't. They're small wires.\"\n","Row:  110\n","Translating  They can do that because  when they are very cold they are what's called superconducting wire.\n","Row:  111\n","Translating  So at minus 271 degrees,  colder than the space between the stars,  those wires can take that current.\n","Row:  112\n","Translating  In one of the joints between over 9,000 magnets in LHC,  there was a manufacturing defect.\n","Row:  113\n","Translating  So the wire heated up slightly,  and its 13,000 amps suddenly encountered electrical resistance.\n","Row:  114\n","Translating  This was the result.\n","Row:  115\n","Translating  Now that's more impressive  when you consider those magnets weigh over 20 tons,  and they moved about a foot.\n","Row:  116\n","Translating  So we damaged about 50 of the magnets.\n","Row:  117\n","Translating  We had to take them out, which we did.\n","Row:  118\n","Translating  We reconditioned them all, fixed them.\n","Row:  119\n","Translating  They're all on their way back underground now.\n","Row:  120\n","Translating  By the end of March the LHC will be intact again.\n","Row:  121\n","Translating  We will switch it on,  and we expect to take data in June or July,  and continue with our quest to find out  what the building blocks of the universe are.\n","Row:  122\n","Translating  Now of course, in a way  those accidents reignite the debate  about the value of science and engineering at the edge. It's easy to refute.\n","Row:  123\n","Translating  I think that the fact that it's so difficult,  the fact that we're overreaching, is the value of things like the LHC.\n","Row:  124\n","Translating  I will leave the final word to an English scientist, Humphrey Davy,  who, I suspect,  when defending his protege's useless experiments --  his protege was Michael Faraday --  said this, \"Nothing is so dangerous  to the progress of the human mind  than to assume that our views of science are ultimate,  that there are no mysteries in nature,  that our triumphs are complete, and that  there are no new worlds to conquer.\"\n","Row:  125\n","Translating  Thank you.\n","Row:  126\n","Translating  I want to start out by asking you to think back to when you were a kid,  playing with blocks.\n","Row:  127\n","Translating  As you figured out how to reach out and grasp,  pick them up and move them around,  you were actually learning how to think and solve problems  by understanding and manipulating spatial relationships.\n","Row:  128\n","Translating  Spatial reasoning is deeply connected  to how we understand a lot of the world around us.\n","Row:  129\n","Translating  So, as a computer scientist  inspired by this utility of our interactions with physical objects --  along with my adviser Pattie, and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi --  I started to wonder -- what if when we used a computer,  instead of having this one mouse cursor that was a like a digital fingertip  moving around a flat desktop,  what if we could reach in with both hands and grasp information physically,\n","Row:  130\n","Translating  arranging it the way we wanted?\n","Row:  131\n","Translating  This question was so compelling that we decided to explore the answer,  by building Siftables.\n","Row:  132\n","Translating  In a nutshell, a Siftable is an interactive computer  the size of a cookie.\n","Row:  133\n","Translating  They're able to be moved around by hand,  they can sense each other, they can sense their motion,  and they have a screen and a wireless radio.\n","Row:  134\n","Translating  Most importantly, they're physical,  so like the blocks, you can move them just by reaching out and grasping.\n","Row:  135\n","Translating  And Siftables are an example of a new ecosystem  of tools for manipulating digital information.\n","Row:  136\n","Translating  And as these tools become more physical,  more aware of their motion, aware of each other,  and aware of the nuance of how we move them,  we can start to explore some new and fun interaction styles.\n","Row:  137\n","Translating  So, I'm going to start with some simple examples.\n","Row:  138\n","Translating  This Siftable is configured to show video,  and if I tilt it in one direction, it'll roll the video this way;  if I tilt it the other way it rolls it backwards.\n","Row:  139\n","Translating  And these interactive portraits are aware of each other.\n","Row:  140\n","Translating  So if I put them next to each other, they get interested.\n","Row:  141\n","Translating  If they get surrounded, they notice that too,  they might get a little flustered.\n","Row:  142\n","Translating  And they can also sense their motion and tilt.\n","Row:  143\n","Translating  One of the interesting implications on interaction, we started to realize,  was that we could use everyday gestures on data,  like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid.\n","Row:  144\n","Translating  So in this case, we've got three Siftables configured to be paint buckets  and I can use them to pour color into that central one,  where they get mixed.\n","Row:  145\n","Translating  If we overshoot, we can pour a little bit back.\n","Row:  146\n","Translating  There are also some neat possibilities for education,  like language, math and logic games  where we want to give people the ability to try things quickly,  and view the results immediately.\n","Row:  147\n","Translating  So here I'm --    This is a Fibonacci sequence that I'm making with a simple equation program.\n","Row:  148\n","Translating  Here we have a word game that's kind of like a mash-up between Scrabble and Boggle.\n","Row:  149\n","Translating  Basically, in every round  you get a randomly assigned letter on each Siftable,  and as you try to make words it checks against a dictionary.\n","Row:  150\n","Translating  Then, after about 30 seconds, it reshuffles,  and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try.\n","Row:  151\n","Translating  Thank you.\n","Row:  152\n","Translating  So these are some kids that came on a field trip to the Media Lab,  and I managed to get them to try it out, and shoot a video.\n","Row:  153\n","Translating  They really loved it.\n","Row:  154\n","Translating  And, one of the interesting things about this kind of application  is that you don't have to give people many instructions.\n","Row:  155\n","Translating  All you have to say is, \"Make words,\"  and they know exactly what to do.\n","Row:  156\n","Translating  So here's another few people trying it out.\n","Row:  157\n","Translating  That's our youngest beta tester, down there on the right.\n","Row:  158\n","Translating  Turns out, all he wanted to do was to stack the Siftables up.\n","Row:  159\n","Translating  So to him, they were just blocks.\n","Row:  160\n","Translating  Now, this is an interactive cartoon application.\n","Row:  161\n","Translating  And we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners.\n","Row:  162\n","Translating  And this is Felix, actually.\n","Row:  163\n","Translating  And he can bring new characters into the scene,  just by lifting the Siftables off the table that have that character shown on them.\n","Row:  164\n","Translating  Here, he's bringing the sun out.\n","Row:  165\n","Translating  Video: The sun is rising.\n","Row:  166\n","Translating  David Merrill: Now he's brought a tractor into the scene.\n","Row:  167\n","Translating  Video: The orange tractor.\n","Row:  168\n","Translating  Good job! Yeah!\n","Row:  169\n","Translating  DM: So by shaking the Siftables and putting them next to each other  he can make the characters interact --  Video: Woof!\n","Row:  170\n","Translating  DM: inventing his own narrative.\n","Row:  171\n","Translating  Video: Hello!\n","Row:  172\n","Translating  DM: It's an open-ended story,  and he gets to decide how it unfolds.\n","Row:  173\n","Translating  Video: Fly away, cat.\n","Row:  174\n","Translating  DM: So, the last example I have time to show you today  is a music sequencing and live performance tool  that we've built recently,  in which Siftables act as sounds  like lead, bass and drums.\n","Row:  175\n","Translating  Each of these has four different variations,  you get to choose which one you want to use.\n","Row:  176\n","Translating  And you can inject these sounds into a sequence  that you can assemble into the pattern that you want.\n","Row:  177\n","Translating  And you inject it by just bumping up the sound Siftable against a sequence Siftable.\n","Row:  178\n","Translating  There are effects that you can control live, like reverb and filter.\n","Row:  179\n","Translating  You attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it.\n","Row:  180\n","Translating  And then, overall effects like tempo and volume  So let's have a look.\n","Row:  181\n","Translating  Video:   DM: We'll start by putting a lead  into two sequence Siftables, arrange them into a series,  extend it, add a little more lead.\n","Row:  182\n","Translating  Now I put a bass line in.\n","Row:  183\n","Translating  Video:   DM: Now I'll put some percussion in.\n","Row:  184\n","Translating  Video:   DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the drums, so I can control the effect live.\n","Row:  185\n","Translating  Video:   DM: I can speed up the whole sequence  by tilting the tempo one way or the other.\n","Row:  186\n","Translating  Video:   DM: And now I'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression.\n","Row:  187\n","Translating  Video:   DM: I can rearrange the sequence while it plays.\n","Row:  188\n","Translating  So I don't have to plan it out in advance, but I can improvise,  making it longer or shorter as I go.\n","Row:  189\n","Translating  And now, finally, I can fade the whole sequence out  using the volume Siftable, tilted to the left.\n","Row:  190\n","Translating  Thank you.\n","Row:  191\n","Translating  So, as you can see,  my passion is for making new human-computer interfaces  that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work.\n","Row:  192\n","Translating  And today, I had time to show you one point in this new design space,  and a few of the possibilities that we're working to bring out of the laboratory.\n","Row:  193\n","Translating  So the thought I want to leave you with  is that we're on the cusp of this new generation of tools  for interacting with digital media  that are going to bring information into our world  on our terms.\n","Row:  194\n","Translating  Thank you very much.\n","Row:  195\n","Translating  I look forward to talking with all of you.\n","Row:  196\n","Translating  I am a writer.\n","Row:  197\n","Translating  Writing books is my profession but it's more than that, of course.\n","Row:  198\n","Translating  It is also my great lifelong love and fascination.\n","Row:  199\n","Translating  And I don't expect that that's ever going to change.\n","Row:  200\n","Translating  But, that said, something kind of peculiar has happened recently  in my life and in my career,  which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work.\n","Row:  201\n","Translating  And the peculiar thing is that I recently wrote this book,  this memoir called \"Eat, Pray, Love\"  which, decidedly unlike any of my previous books,  went out in the world for some reason, and became this big,  mega-sensation, international bestseller thing.\n","Row:  202\n","Translating  The result of which is that everywhere I go now,  people treat me like I'm doomed.\n","Row:  203\n","Translating  Seriously -- doomed, doomed!\n","Row:  204\n","Translating  Like, they come up to me now, all worried, and they say,  \"Aren't you afraid you're never going to be able to top that?\n","Row:  205\n","Translating  Aren't you afraid you're going to keep writing for your whole life  and you're never again going to create a book  that anybody in the world cares about at all,  ever again?\"\n","Row:  206\n","Translating  So that's reassuring, you know.\n","Row:  207\n","Translating  But it would be worse, except for that I happen to remember  that over 20 years ago, when I was a teenager,  when I first started telling people that I wanted to be a writer,  I was met with this same sort of fear-based reaction.\n","Row:  208\n","Translating  And people would say, \"Aren't you afraid you're never going to have any success?\n","Row:  209\n","Translating  Aren't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you?\n","Row:  210\n","Translating  Aren't you afraid that you're going to work your whole life at this craft and nothing's ever going to come of it  and you're going to die on a scrap heap of broken dreams  with your mouth filled with bitter ash of failure?\"   Like that, you know.\n","Row:  211\n","Translating  The answer -- the short answer to all those questions is, \"Yes.\"\n","Row:  212\n","Translating  Yes, I'm afraid of all those things.\n","Row:  213\n","Translating  And I always have been.\n","Row:  214\n","Translating  And I'm afraid of many, many more things besides  that people can't even guess at,  like seaweed and other things that are scary.\n","Row:  215\n","Translating  But, when it comes to writing,  the thing that I've been sort of thinking about lately, and wondering about lately, is why?\n","Row:  216\n","Translating  You know, is it rational?\n","Row:  217\n","Translating  Is it logical that anybody should be expected  to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this Earth to do.\n","Row:  218\n","Translating  And what is it specifically about creative ventures  that seems to make us really nervous about each other's mental health  in a way that other careers kind of don't do, you know?\n","Row:  219\n","Translating  Like my dad, for example, was a chemical engineer  and I don't recall once in his 40 years of chemical engineering  anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer, you know?\n","Row:  220\n","Translating  \"That chemical-engineering block, John, how's it going?\"\n","Row:  221\n","Translating  It just didn't come up like that, you know?\n","Row:  222\n","Translating  But to be fair, chemical engineers as a group  haven't really earned a reputation over the centuries  for being alcoholic manic-depressives.   We writers, we kind of do have that reputation,  and not just writers, but creative people across all genres,  it seems, have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable.\n","Row:  223\n","Translating  And all you have to do is look at the very grim death count  in the 20th century alone, of really magnificent creative minds  who died young and often at their own hands, you know?\n","Row:  224\n","Translating  And even the ones who didn't literally commit suicide  seem to be really undone by their gifts, you know.\n","Row:  225\n","Translating  Norman Mailer, just before he died, last interview, he said,  \"Every one of my books has killed me a little more.\"\n","Row:  226\n","Translating  An extraordinary statement to make about your life's work.\n","Row:  227\n","Translating  But we don't even blink when we hear somebody say this,  because we've heard that kind of stuff for so long  and somehow we've completely internalized and accepted collectively  this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow inherently linked  and that artistry, in the end, will always ultimately lead to anguish.\n","Row:  228\n","Translating  And the question that I want to ask everybody here today  is are you guys all cool with that idea?\n","Row:  229\n","Translating  Are you comfortable with that?\n","Row:  230\n","Translating  Because you look at it even from an inch away and, you know --  I'm not at all comfortable with that assumption.\n","Row:  231\n","Translating  I think it's odious.\n","Row:  232\n","Translating  And I also think it's dangerous,  and I don't want to see it perpetuated into the next century.\n","Row:  233\n","Translating  I think it's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live.\n","Row:  234\n","Translating  And I definitely know that, in my case -- in my situation --  it would be very dangerous for me to start sort of leaking down that dark path  of assumption,  particularly given the circumstance that I'm in right now in my career.\n","Row:  235\n","Translating  Which is -- you know, like check it out,  I'm pretty young, I'm only about 40 years old.\n","Row:  236\n","Translating  I still have maybe another four decades of work left in me.\n","Row:  237\n","Translating  And it's exceedingly likely that anything I write from this point forward  is going to be judged by the world as the work that came after  the freakish success of my last book, right?\n","Row:  238\n","Translating  I should just put it bluntly, because we're all sort of friends here now --  it's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me.\n","Row:  239\n","Translating  So Jesus, what a thought!\n","Row:  240\n","Translating  That's the kind of thought that could lead a person  to start drinking gin at nine o'clock in the morning,  and I don't want to go there.\n","Row:  241\n","Translating  I would prefer to keep doing this work that I love.\n","Row:  242\n","Translating  And so, the question becomes, how?\n","Row:  243\n","Translating  And so, it seems to me, upon a lot of reflection,  that the way that I have to work now, in order to continue writing,  is that I have to create some sort of protective psychological construct, right?\n","Row:  244\n","Translating  I have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance  between me, as I am writing, and my very natural anxiety  about what the reaction to that writing is going to be, from now on.\n","Row:  245\n","Translating  And, as I've been looking, over the last year,  for models for how to do that, I've been sort of looking across time,  and I've been trying to find other societies  to see if they might have had better and saner ideas than we have  about how to help creative people  sort of manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity.\n","Row:  246\n","Translating  And that search has led me to ancient Greece and ancient Rome.\n","Row:  247\n","Translating  So stay with me, because it does circle around and back.\n","Row:  248\n","Translating  But, ancient Greece and ancient Rome --  people did not happen to believe that creativity  came from human beings back then, OK?\n","Row:  249\n","Translating  People believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit  that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source,  for distant and unknowable reasons.\n","Row:  250\n","Translating  The Greeks famously called these divine attendant spirits of creativity \"daemons.\"\n","Row:  251\n","Translating  Socrates, famously, believed that he had a daemon  who spoke wisdom to him from afar.\n","Row:  252\n","Translating  The Romans had the same idea,  but they called that sort of disembodied creative spirit a genius.\n","Row:  253\n","Translating  Which is great, because the Romans did not actually think  that a genius was a particularly clever individual.\n","Row:  254\n","Translating  They believed that a genius was this, sort of magical divine entity,  who was believed to literally live in the walls of an artist's studio,  kind of like Dobby the house elf, and who would come out  and sort of invisibly assist the artist with their work  and would shape the outcome of that work.\n","Row:  255\n","Translating  So brilliant -- there it is, right there, that distance that I'm talking about --  that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work.\n","Row:  256\n","Translating  And everyone knew that this is how it functioned, right?\n","Row:  257\n","Translating  So the ancient artist was protected from certain things,  like, for example, too much narcissism, right?\n","Row:  258\n","Translating  If your work was brilliant, you couldn't take all the credit for it,  everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had

day he was driving down the freeway in Los Angeles,  and this is when it all changed for him.\n","Row:  301\n","Translating  And he's speeding along, and all of a sudden  he hears this little fragment

314\n","Translating  But the process, and the heavy anxiety around it  was released when he took the genie, the genius out of him  where it was causing nothing but trouble, and released it back where it came from,  and realized that this didn't have to be this internalized, tormented thing.\n","Row:  315\n","Translating  It could be this peculiar, wondrous, bizarre collaboration,  kind of conversation between Tom and the strange, external thing  that was not quite Tom.\n","Row:  316\n","Translating  When I heard that story, it started to shift a little bit  the way that I worked too,

the worst book ever written.\n","Row:  319\n","Translating  And I started to think I should just dump this project.\n","Row:  320\n","Translating  But then I remembered Tom talking to the open air and I tried it.\n","Row:  321\n","Translating  So I just lifted my face up from the manuscript  and I directed my comments to an empty corner of the room.\n","Row:  322\n","Translating  And I said aloud, \"Listen you, thing,  you and I both know that if this book isn't brilliant  that is not entirely my fault, right?\n","Row:  323\n","Translating  Because you can see that I am putting everything I

 people used to gather for these moonlight dances of sacred dance and music  that would go on for hours and hours, until dawn.\n","Row:  329\n","Translating  They were always magnificent, because the dancers were professionals  and they were terrific, right?\n","Row:  330\n","Translating  But every once in a while, very rarely, something would happen,  and one of these performers would actually become transcendent.\n","Row:  331\n","Translating  And I know you know what I'm talking about,  because I know you've all seen, at some point in your life, a performance like this.\n","Row:  332\n","Translating  It was like time would stop,  and the dancer would sort of step through some kind of portal  and he wasn't doing anything different than he had ever done, 1,000 nights before,

below  and all lit up on fire with divinity.\n","Row:  335\n","Translating  And when this happened, back then,  people knew it for what it was, you know, they called it by its name.\n","Row:  336\n","Translating  They would put their hands together and they would start to chant,  \"Allah, Allah, Allah, God, God, God.\"\n","Row:  337\n","Translating  That's God, you know.\n","Row:  338\n","Translating  Curious historical footnote: when the Moors invaded southern Spain, they took this custom with them  and the pronunciation changed over the centuries  from \"Allah, Allah, Allah,\" to \"Olé, olé, olé,\"  which you still hear in bullfights and in flamenco dances.\n","Row:  339\n","Translating  In Spain, when a performer has done something impossible and magic,  \"Allah,

tricky bit comes the next morning,  for the dancer himself, when he wakes up and discovers  that it's Tuesday at 11 a.m., and he's no longer a glimpse of God.\n","Row:  342\n","Translating  He's just an aging mortal with really bad knees,  and maybe he's never going to ascend to that height again.\n","Row:  343\n","Translating  And maybe nobody will ever chant God's name again as he spins,  and what is he then to do with the rest of his life?\n","Row:  344\n","Translating  This is hard.\n","Row:  345\n","Translating  This is one of the most painful reconciliations to make  in a creative life.\n","Row:  346\n","Translating  But maybe it doesn't have to be quite so full of anguish  if you never happened to believe, in the first place,  that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you.\n","Row:  347\n","Translating  But maybe if you just believed that they were on loan to you  from some unimaginable source for some exquisite portion of your life  to be passed along when you're finished, with somebody else.\n","Row:  348\n","Translating  And, you know, if we think about it this way, it starts to change everything.\n","Row:  349\n","Translating  This is how I've
