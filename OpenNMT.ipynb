      "['在人们的生活里加进选择，除了提高人们对事情到底能有多好的期望值以外并没有给人们带来多少好处。']\n",
      "['带来的只是使人们对结果不那么满意了，即使那是好结果。']\n",

      "我答应过会回来告诉你那台机器是怎么工作的\n",
      "这就是它。而对于你们这些不在那里的人来说，LHC是有史以来最大的科学实验——周长27公里。\n",
      "它的工作是重新创造宇宙开始后不到十亿分之一秒的条件最多每秒六亿倍\n",
      "这不是什么，如果不是野心勃勃。\n",
      "这是日内瓦下面的机器\n",
      "我们拍下探测器里那些小爆炸的照片\n",
      "这是我工作的一个。它被称为ATLAS探测器——宽44米，直径22米。\n",
      "这里的外观图ATLAS正在建设中，所以你可以看到尺度。\n",
      "去年9月10日我们第一次打开了机器\n",
      "这张照片是ATLAS拍摄的。\n",
      "它在控制室引起了巨大的庆祝。\n",
      "这是第一束粒子环绕LHC一路行走的图片，与LHC的一块片段故意相撞，并将颗粒冲入探测器。\n",
      "换句话说，当我们在9月10日看到那张照片时，我们知道机器是有效的，这是一个伟大的胜利。\n",
      "我不知道这是否是最大的欢呼声，还是这个，当有人去谷歌，看到头版是这样。\n",
      "意味着我们产生了文化影响和科学影响。\n",
      "大约一周后，我们发现机器出了问题，与这些线条有关——这些金线。\n",
      "当机器全速运转时，这些电线携带着13000安培。\n",
      "现在你们中的工程师们会看着他们说，“不，他们不会。他们是小电线”.\n",
      "他们可以这样做，因为当他们非常寒冷的时候，他们是所谓的超导线。\n",
      "因此，在零下271度，比恒星之间的空间更冷，这些线可以带走电流。\n",

      "于是电线稍加热，其13000安培突然遇到电阻。\n",
      "这就是结果。\n",
      "更令人印象深刻的是，你认为磁铁重超过20吨，它们移动了大约一英尺。\n",
      "所以我们损坏了大约50个磁铁。\n",

      "空间推理与我们如何理解我们周围许多世界密切相关。\n",
      "因此，作为一个计算机科学家，我们与物理物体的相互作用----以及我的顾问Pattie和我的合作者JeevanKalanithi----所激发的灵感，我开始怀疑----如果我们使用一台计算机，而不是让这个像数字指尖的鼠标光标在平面桌面上移动，如果我们能用双手伸手并实际掌握信息，怎么办？\n",
      "按我们的要求安排？\n",
      "这个问题非常有说服力，以至于我们决定通过建造Sifstables来探索答案。\n",
      "简言之，Siftable是一台与饼干大小相同的交互式计算机。\n",
      "它们能被手动移动，能感应到彼此，能感应到自己的运动，并有屏幕和无线无线电。\n",
      "最重要的是，它们是物理的，所以像块，你可以移动它们只是通过伸手和抓住。\n",
      "而Siftables是操纵数字信息工具新生态系统的一个例子。\n",
      "随着这些工具变得更加物理化，更了解它们的运动，互相认识，也意识到我们如何移动这些工具的细微差别，我们可以开始探索一些新的有趣的互动风格。\n",
      "因此，我首先要举几个简单的例子。\n",
      "这个Siftable是用来显示视频的，如果我把它向一个方向倾斜，它会这样滚动；如果我把它向另一个方向倾斜，它会倒转。\n",
      "而这些交互式的肖像画是互相认识的。\n",
      "所以如果我把它们放在彼此身边，他们就会感兴趣。\n",
      "如果他们被包围了，他们也注意到了，他们可能会有点毛骨悚然。\n",
      "他们也可以感知到他们的运动和倾斜。\n",
      "我们开始意识到，对相互作用的一个有趣的影响是，我们可以用日常的手势来记录数据，就像注入一种颜色，我们可能注入一种液体。\n",
      "因此，在这种情况下，我们有三个Siftable配置成油漆桶，我可以用它们把颜色倒进中央的，在那里它们被混合。\n",
      "如果我们过度射击，我们可以倒回一点点。\n",
      "教育也有一些绝妙的可能性，比如语言，数学和逻辑游戏，我们想赋予人们快速尝试事物的能力，并立即查看结果。\n",
      "所以这里и...这是我用一个简单的方程式制作的Fibonacci序列。\n",
      "在这里，我们有一个字游戏有点像拼字游戏和博格游戏。\n",
      "基本上，在每个回合中，你都会在每一个Siftable上得到一个随机指定的字母，当你试图用字典来检查字典时。\n",
      "然后，在大约30秒后，它会重新洗涤，你有一套新的字母和新的可能尝试。\n",
      "谢谢\n",
      "这些是一些孩子，他们来到了媒体实验室，我设法让他们尝试一下，然后拍摄一段视频。\n",

      "然后有这些时间--这是我从未忘记的作品--她说，有时她几乎会想念它，对吧？\n",
      "于是，她跑到屋里，找着报纸，诗歌通过她，她拿着一支铅笔，就像它穿过她一样，然后她说，就像她伸出另一只手，抓住它。\n",
      "她会用尾巴抓住这首诗，当她在页面上翻转时，她会把它拉回身体。\n",
      "在这些例子中，这首诗会出现在页面上完美和完整，但倒着，从最后一个字到第一个字。\n",

      "我之前已经谈到过其中的一些项目——人类基因组，以及那可能意味着什么，并发现了新的基因组。\n",
      "我们实际上开始于一个新的点：我们一直在把生物学数字化，现在我们试图从那个数字代码进入生物学的新阶段，设计和合成生命。\n",

      "全世界有数以万计的机器可以制作小块DNA--长度为30到50个字母--这是一个堕落的过程，所以你做的越长，错误就越多。\n",

      "新染色体进入细胞。\n",
      "事实上，我们觉得这也许已经过去了，但我们试图进一步设计这一进程。\n",
      "这是一个主要的进化机制在这里。\n",
      "我们发现所有种类的物种从某个地方摄入了第二染色体或第三染色体，给该物种增加了数千个新特征。\n",
      "所以，那些认为进化只是一个基因在一次改变的人错过了很多生物学。\n",
      "有一些酶称为限制酶，实际上能消化DNA.\n",
      "细胞里的染色体没有染色体；我们放进去的染色体有染色体。\n",
      "它被表达出来，它认出其他的染色体是外来物质，咀嚼了它，所以我们最后用一个新的染色体的细胞。\n",

      "所有这些选择都有两个效果，两个对人有负面的影响。\n",
      "矛盾的是，一种效果是造成瘫痪，而不是解放。\n",
      "有很多选择，人们觉得很难选择。\n",
      "我举一个非常戏剧性的例子：对自愿退休计划投资的研究。\n",
      "我的一位同事从“先锋”公司获得了投资记录，该公司拥有约100万雇员和约2000个不同的工作场所。\n",
      "她发现雇主提供的每10个共同基金参与率就下降了2%。\n",
      "你提供50个基金--比只提供5个员工少10%。为什么？\n",
      "因为有50个基金可以选择，很难决定哪一个基金可以选择，所以你会把它拖到明天。\n",
      "然后明天，明天，明天，当然明天永远不会来。\n",
      "要知道，这不仅意味着人们在退休时会因为没有足够的钱而不得不吃狗粮，这也意味着做出这样的决定非常困难，以至于从雇主那里传递了相当可观的对应资金。\n",
      "他们不参与，每年就从雇主那里流出多达5000美元，而雇主愿意支付与其缴款相当的费用。\n",
      "因此，瘫痪是选择过多的结果。\n",
      "我认为这让世界变得这样。\n",
      "你真的想做出正确的决定如果它是永远的，对不对？\n",
      "你不想选择错误的互助基金或错误的沙拉酱。\n",
      "所以这就是一个效果。第二个影响是，即使我们设法克服瘫痪状态并作出选择，我们最终对选择结果的满意程度低于如果我们选择的选项较少的话。\n",
      "这样做有几个原因。\n",
      "其中一个是，用很多不同的沙拉敷料来选择，如果你买了，它不完美——什么沙拉敷料？---说很容易想象你会做出一个更好的选择\n",
      "会发生什么是这个想象的替代方案诱导你后悔你所做的决定，而这个遗憾从你所做的决定的满意程度中减去，即使这是一个很好的决定。\n",
      "选择越多，就越容易后悔你所选择的选择会令人失望\n",
      "第二，经济学家所说的”机会成本”.\n",
      "DanGilbert今早说到一个大问题我们重视事物的方式取决于我们对它们的比较\n",
      "当有许多替代品需要考虑时，很容易想象你所拒绝的替代品的吸引力让你对所选择的替代品不太满意。\n",
      "举个例子【我不停地想着W85街的其他停车位】对不起，如果你不是纽约人。\n",

      "他花了两周的时间沉迷于他错过了日复一日的车位的机会\n",
      "机会的代价会从我们选择的满足度中减去，即使我们选择的很好。\n",
      "越多的选项需要考虑，这些选项的更具吸引力的特征将被我们反映为机会成本。\n",
      "这里还有一个例子。现在，这卡通有很多要点。\n",
      "它提出了关于生活的时刻，可能关于做事情的慢。\n",
      "但其中的一点是，当你选择一件事的时候，你选择不做其他可能具有许多吸引力的事物，这会降低你所做的事情的吸引力。\n",
      "第三：期望的提高。\n",
      "我换牛仔裤的时候就被它撞到了\n",
      "我几乎总是穿牛仔裤。\n",
      "曾经有一次牛仔裤是用一种口味来的，你买了它们，它们像垃圾一样合身，它们非常不舒服，如果你穿它们，并洗了足够多的时间，它们开始感觉很好。\n",

      "他不知道那是什么，所以我花了一个小时尝试所有这些该死的牛仔裤，我走出商店--真相！--\n",
      "我表现得更好所有这些选择使我得以做得更好。\n",
      "不过...我觉得更糟。\n",
      "为什么？我写了整本书来解释这件事\n",
      "我感到更糟的原因是，有了所有这些选择，我对牛仔裤应该多好的期望应该提高。\n",
      "我有一个非常低的，没有特别的期望当他们只来一种味道。\n",
      "当他们有100种口味的时候，该死其中一种应该很完美\n",
      "我得到了好，但并不完美。\n",
      "于是我把我得到的东西和我的预期做了比较，和我预期的相比，我得到的东西令人失望。\n",
      "给人们的生活增加选择，不能不提高人们对于这些选择会有多好的期望。\n",
      "而这会产生的结果是，对结果的满意程度较低，即使这些结果都是好的。\n",
      "在营销界没有人知道这一点。\n",
      "因为如果他们这样做，你们不会都知道这是什么。\n",
      "事实是这样的【一切都好回来，当一切都更糟】当每件事都更糟的时候，一切都会好起来，原因是当每件事都更糟的时候，人们实际上有可能有一个令人愉快的惊喜。\n",
      "今天，我们所生活的世界----我们富裕的工业化公民，充满了完美的期望----你所希望的最好就是，东西和你所期望的一样好。\n",
      "你永远不会令人愉快地感到惊讶，因为你的期望，我的期望，已经过了屋顶。\n",
      "幸福的秘密——这就是你们来的目的——幸福的秘密是低期望。\n",

biosphere were seriously eroded, so did the races, and it was destroyed faster.', 'No biologist has dared to assert that 50 percent or more of the species are extinct, or are on the brink of

have been a lot of people who have forgotten what I've said about different ways of living.\", 'For example, this child lives in the area of Balasara, northwest of Amazonia, and they are called the Samsun family because they believe in the legend that they came from the eastern bank of the Milke River and were born from the sacred snake-breath.', 'The people of this community cannot distinguish between blue and green, because the jungle is their habitat, so in their view, the dome is not different from the tree crowns of the forest.', \"It's based on mythology's history, and you can see a

the mystery, I have to figure out what this magic religion of voodoo is all about.', \"Instead, it's a complex world view of schooling.\", \"It's funny.\", 'If I asked you to list some important

danced at the temple and became gods.', \"How can you be hurt if you're possessed by God?\", \"So you're going to see some amazing phenomena where the voodoo nuns go into a state of disillusionment,

itself exists because the human consciousness absorbs the essence of nature.', 'So, what does that mean?', 'We can say, for example, that a child living in the Andes, and the adults have taught him

to see a layer of blue smoke, which is a branch of a shrub with a coffee called nine trees.\", \"It's mixed up.\", 'This plant has a strong pigmentine.', 'The people of the Yanomami tribe will also

Even though we managed to overcome rigidity and paralysis and finally made the right decision, we were more satisfied with the decisions we made than we did when there was less choice.', 'There are several reasons.', \"One of them is that, in the face of so many salad varieties, if you buy one, you don't feel like it, you can easily imagine if you pick the other.\", \"How did it go? This other choice in your imagination leads you to regret the decision you've made, the regret that makes you less satisfied with the choice you made, even if it's actually a good one.\", \"The more you choose, the easier it is to regret something. And that's the first thing that's never been satisfied with the choices you make.\", 'Second, what economists call “opportunity costs”.', 'Dan earlier today. Gilbert tells the big story that the value of looking at one thing depends on the other things we use to compare.', \"Well, when people have a lot of options to think about, it's easy to imagine the attractive aspects of the choices you gave up. That makes you always think that you've chosen someone that's not good enough.\", \"For example, I apologize if you're not from New York.\", \"But that's what you should be thinking right now.\", 'Look at these two mouths of Hampton.', \"It's an expensive rich neighborhood.\", 'The gorgeous beaches, the sunshine, they own all of this.', 'Could it be better? And this time, it\\'s like, \"Hmm, that\\'s bad luck.\"', '\"If I go back, I can park in front of my own door.\"', 'And then for two weeks, he was tortured by the idea of losing the opportunity to take that good parking space.', 'The \"opportunity costs\" always make us less satisfied with the decisions that have been made, even if they are actually wise.', \"The more options we're facing, the more attractive things we're going to find, the more opportunity costs.\", 'That is another example. This cartoon illustrates several problems.', 'It also speaks of living in the present. It may also include doing things step by step.', \"But one reason is that when you choose something, you choose not to do anything else. These other things tend to have a lot of attraction for you, and they weaken the appeal for you of what you're doing.\", 'Thirdly, expectations have increased.', 'This was very touching on me once when I went to buy a new pair of jeans.', 'I almost always wear jeans.', \"In the past, jeans were that kind of style, and you bought them back, they weren't right, they were bad, and they were very uncomfortable, until you wore them long enough, washed them a million times, and they didn't fit.\", 'So, after all these years of old pants, I finally went out to get a new one. I said, \"Hey, I want a pair of jeans, that\\'s my size.\"', 'The clerk said, \"Do you want a tight, comfortable, loose?', 'The button or the zipper? Stone grind or acid wash?', \"You want the kind that's grinding?\", 'Straight or narrow? He kept asking.', 'My chin almost fell off. And when I came to God, I said, \"I want the kind of style that was the only one.\"', 'He was all fogged, and it took me an hour to try on all these damn jeans, and finally, to be honest, I walked out of the store with the best pants I ever had.', 'I did good. These choices give me a chance to do better.', 'But it felt worse.', 'Why? I wrote a book for this to make excuses for myself.', 'What makes me feel worse is that, with so much choice, my expectations of how good a pair of jeans should be are so much higher.', \"I used to expect low values. I didn't expect too much when the jeans were just like that.\", 'When they have a hundred specifications, well, at least one is perfect.', \"I do have a good one, but it's not perfect.\", \"So I compare what I already have with what I expected, and what I expected, and I'm disappointed with this.\", \"The addition of choices to people's lives, apart from raising expectations about how good things are, has not been very beneficial to people.\", \"It's just that people are less satisfied with the results, even if they're good.\", 'Nobody in the market understands that.', \"Because if any of them understood, you wouldn't have had a chance to know what that means.\", \"It's like this. It's better than it is when everything was bad.\", \"Now, in the world in which we rich, industrialized citizens live, it is only natural to be perfect, and you can only hope for everything if it isn't worse than you expected.\", \"You'll never be surprised again, because my expectations are higher than the sky.\", \"What's the secret to happiness, which is what you're here to know today, is the secret to happiness: be content with normality, not overambitious.\", \"I'd like to take a moment to say that I'm married to my wife, and she's a good wife.\", \"I didn't get along on this. I tried.\", 'But integration is not necessarily bad.', \"And finally, one of the results of buying an unsuited pair of jeans is that when there's only one style available in the store, you don't like it, you want to know why, and who is responsible? The answer is obvious.\", 'The world is responsible for this. Is there anything you can do?', \"Now there are hundreds of jeans in the store for your choice, and you bought one back and you're not satisfied, and you ask why, who's responsible?\", 'Now the answer to this question is obviously you.', 'You can totally do better.', 'There are hundreds of jeans in there, and you have no excuse to screw things up.', \"And the result is that when people make decisions, even if that decision is good, they're disappointed, and they blame themselves.\", 'In our past generation, there has been an explosion of clinical depression in the industrialized world.', \"I believe that one of the most important factors in this explosive growth of depression and suicide is not the only one, but the most important factor is all the disappointing experiences of people. The reason is that their standards are too high. When they have to explain what these experiences are about, they think it's their own fault.\", \"And the net effect is that, although objectively we're doing better than before, it's not as good as before.\", 'I remind you,', \"And this is the accepted doctrine of happiness that we all think is right, but it's wrong. Absolutely not.\", 'There is no doubt that there is a better choice than there is no choice, but the more choices can be deduced.', \"Here's a key value, I don't know how much.\", \"But I'm sure we've already gone far beyond the critical value of choosing to make us rich.\", \"I'm almost done. Now for a policy issue, one of the policy issues that we need to think about is that what brings so many choices to our industrialized society is a huge wealth of matter.\", \"There's a lot of places in our world, at least a few of them we've heard of, where the problem isn't too much choice.\", \"It's almost nothing.\", \"So this topic I'm talking about here is a modern rich Western society.\", \"A special problem. Steve. As Levitte said yesterday, the outrage is that the expensive and inoperable baby car seats that we're producing are useless, just a waste of money.\", \"And what I'm trying to say today is that these expensive, complex choices are not just useless.\", \"They're actually hurting us.\", 'They actually make us worse.', \"If we devote part of the human and material resources that make these choices to societies where people don't have enough choice now, it's not just where people's lives can be improved, but our own quality of life can be improved. That's what economists call Paretto's improvement.\", 'The redistribution of products will make life better for everyone, not just the poor, because we\\'re free of the extra choices that plagues us and you should look at this comic before you\\'re done and stand by a wise man and say, \"Well, what does this fish know?', 'I\\'m telling you, nothing is possible in this fish tank.\"', \"Unimaginable, short-sighted -- that's how I read it the first time I saw it.\", 'But the more I think about it, the more obviously the fish must know something.', 'Because to be honest, if you want to make everything possible and break the fish tank, you get not freedom, but paralysis.', \"If you want to make everything possible and break the fish tank, you're less satisfied.\", 'You add paralysis, you reduce satisfaction.', 'Everyone needs this fish tank.', \"As for this fish, it's probably a little small, and it's almost too small for us.\", 'But the absence of such a symbolic fish tank would mean suffering, perhaps disaster.', 'Thank you very much.']\n"
